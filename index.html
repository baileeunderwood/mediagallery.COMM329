            <h4>Decluttered Space </h4>
            <p>Scandinavian decor follows a “less is more” design mantra. In the 1950s and ‘60s, Scandinavian homes were traditionally small, so they didn’t allow for extravagant amounts of decorative items and accents. Thus, designers tend to avoid ornate or excessive detailing, and storage is wisely implemented.</p>

            <h4>Muted Colors</h4>
            <p>Scandinavian design often boasts a neutral-heavy color palette. Because winters are long and dark in Northern Europe, Nordic design utilizes whites, greys, and tans to make a space feel uniform and bright. Often, accents of blue and other bold colors are incorporated loosely throughout.</p>

            <p>Natural lighting is used to make a space feel bigger and brighter. White walls emphasize available light, and minimal use of window treatments allow natural light to illuminate spaces.</p>

            <h4>Wooden Accents</h4>
            <p>Wood is often incorporated into the design of a space through walls, wood slats, and flooring. Wooden toys, like that of Danish designer Kay Bojesen’s iconic wooden monkey introduced in 1951, can also be placed around rooms as playful accents. Often, designers juxtapose the hard, dense material with rugs or sheepskin textiles to soften the feel of a space. In keeping with the light and bright aesthetic of Scandinavian design, light woods such as beech, ash, and pine are typically used most.</p>

        <h4>Decluttered Space</h4>
        <p>Before anyone can attempt to bring a Scandi design into their space they must first declutter every single nook and cranny. As we are at the end of November now is the perfect time to declutter your space and get it ready for the New Year.

          Did you know that decluttering can become an important way to practice self-care because it helps you take control of your home, your life and all of your belongings?  Science says decluttering can to improve your overall well-being.
          
          It’s also feels nicer to have a home that can give you the time, space, energy and clarity to improve your health, happiness and overall well-being. Go and get to it and Marie Kondo your house!</p>

        <h4>Muted Colors</h4>
        <p>The colour palette consists of a variation of neutral shades with whites as the main backdrop to this style with a couple of lighter tone colours used as accents. This gives the added benefit of making rooms look more spacious and classy. </p>

      <div class="card-text none" id="982nd">
        <h4>Natural Lighting</h4>
        <p>Light in Scandinavian design became really important due to countries experiencing prolonged periods of darkness known as polar nights so natural light is always maximised in their interior design.

          So if windows can be left bare this is done. However if you need something for privacy sheer curtains are often used to let light seep in without being too jarring.</p>

        <h4>Wood Accents</h4>
        <p>Nature is a huge part of Scandinavian interior design. Think about elements, such as light and bright wood, nature-inspired sculptural pieces, house plants, and natural textiles and upholstery, such as wool, sheepskin, linen etc. And whenever you can, use eco-friendly and sustainable materials in your home. Pop a plant or two on your table or at the corner of your room to add some life to any room in your home.</p>
